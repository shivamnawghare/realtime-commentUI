# realtime-commentUI
Q.2 . Create a simple login form where a user can sign in and then there should be one page where user can rate as well as put comments on the movies (you can make list of any 10 movies). The average rating and comments should be visible besides the movie name.
 you can use Angular, HTML, CSS and JS to create this page. For Backend you can use ASP .net MVC or Node.js.
Data storage can be done in JSON file (Be Creative with UI) or you can use any Database (SQL, MongoDB, etc).

Explaination of remaining part of project:

The project tells about a list of movies and by clicking ona particular movie we can comment as if we are on a real website.
index.html page contains UI how the user will see movie page.
index.html related css and js files are in folder 'css' and 'js'.
In command prompt express should be installed first.
Then 'npm install nodemon -D'.
Then 'npm run dev'.
You will get listening 3000.
Go to localhost 3000.
You will get pop up box put user name.
And post comment.
And keep on posting comments and the UI will look like a website.
